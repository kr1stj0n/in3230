# Plenum + ORAKEL (IN3230) - Finite State Machine

In this example, we implement a simple FSM that keeps track of the states
between the client and server.
Both the client and server send HELLO messages every 5 seconds.
HELLO timeout is set 10 seconds.

Usage:

- `make all` to compile the programs.
- Run the server first using `./server`, and then `./client` to run the client.


Practise and implement new features in the applications.
Good luck :-)
